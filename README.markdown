This is a sample mutt configuration which resembles the setup I currently use.

It's *really* basic, and just provides some basic setup, but I feel like it's a good starting point for a more complex mutt configuration.

I [blogged about this setup here][muttblogpost] and some of the steps I took.
I tried to make the repository resemble the iterative process my muttrc went through while creating it, but really, there's not much else to this other than personal tweaks.

This is *not* meant to be an "oh-my-mutt" type of setup, though that would be really neat to have, and I might do something like that at some point.
This is only meant to provide a basic starting point for a new mutt user to not get too overwhelmed when setting up their first muttrc.

The [Solarized mutt theme][mutt-solarized] is being pulled in as a submodule. It's probably out of date. Feel free to update it.
